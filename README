DESCRIPTION
    You can define several connections in "connections" hash, and select
    which one should be used currently via "active_connection". You
    shouldn't define "connect_info" - it will be set for you, depending on
    what you set in "active_connection" and "connections".

    This trait will do something only if you set "active_connection",
    otherwise it just do nothing, like it was not used at all.

TODO
    Write tests.
