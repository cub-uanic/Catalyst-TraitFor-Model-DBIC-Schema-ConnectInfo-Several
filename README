DESCRIPTION
    You can define several named connections in "connection" hash, and
    selectr which one should be used currently with "active_connection". You
    shouldn't define "connect_info", it will be set for you, depending on
    what you set in "active_connection" and "connection". Also, set
    "AutoCommit" option for you to 1, if you don't set it yet.

    This trait will do something only if you set "active_connection",
    otherwise it just do nothing, like it was not used at all.

TODO
    Write tests.
